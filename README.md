## About me

- Hey! Welcome to my profile! I am a person who loves **Touhou** (of course), **coding** and doing some **new stuffs**
- I often use **C++**, **Python** and **Java** for most of my project
- I love contributing my works to the public, helping other peoples
- I rarely watched anime but here's one of my favourite:

### Musou Kakyou: A Summer Day's Dream (夢想夏郷 A Summer Day's Dream, "Fantasy Summer Land")

Not the first Touhou based anime that I've watched but this is definitely a good one with unpredictable ending, I recommend you to watch this one, trust me.

### Fantasy Kaleidoscope ~ The Memories of Phantasm ~

The is the first Touhou based I've watched, I've even thought it is Touhou, well, Touhou is a game not an anime. This is also a great one

### Favourite character

One of my favourite character is **Saigyouji Yuyuko**, please don't judge me

### Favourite games

I don't play games a lot, just sometimes, but my favourite is **Touhou Project**, **Minecraft** and **Counter Strike** (I am bad at this)

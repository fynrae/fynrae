# About me
Hey! Welcome to my profile! I am a person who loves Touhou (of course), coding and doing some new stuffs

I often use C++, Python and Java for most of my project

I rarely watched any anime but here's one of my favourite:

## Musou Kakyou: A Summer Day's Dream (夢想夏郷 A Summer Day's Dream, "Fantasy Summer Land")

Not the first Touhou based anime that I've watched but this is definitely a good one with unpredictable ending, I recommend you to watch this one, trust me.

## Fantasy Kaleidoscope ~ The Memories of Phantasm ~

The is the first Touhou based I've watched, I've even thought it is Touhou, well, Touhou is a game not an anime. This is also a great one
